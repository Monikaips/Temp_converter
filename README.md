**Introduction:**

**Description:**
The Temperature Converter project, developed by Monika, is a straightforward web application designed to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin units. Users can input a temperature value in one unit and select the unit they want to convert it to. The application then displays the converted temperature along with a visual representation on a thermometer.

**Features:**

1. **User-friendly Interface:** Monika has created a clean and intuitive web interface with input fields and dropdown menus for easy temperature conversion.

2. **Temperature Conversion:** The application accurately converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin units based on user input. Monika has implemented conversion logic to ensure precise results.

3. **Validation:** Monika has included validation checks to ensure that the temperature input is a valid number. If the input is invalid, an alert message prompts the user to enter a valid temperature.

4. **Visual Representation:** Monika has implemented a thermometer graphic to visually represent the converted temperature. The thermometer features color-coded segments indicating temperature ranges for better visualization.
